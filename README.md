# Just Eat? Just Meet!
Guests running late but you want to order now? Everyone fighting over a single phone to pick from the menu? Fix that problem with this new feature!

## Worried about the wait? Let us take that off your plate!
Pick your restaurant and start your order, then just send out your unique order link. They can add their items on their way to you, saving you the hassle. Get updates by checking our handy table feature, which updates each time someone completes picking their order. Once everyone is done, you can check out for the whole group. The creator of the order must approve the whole order to checkout. This feature can be used by anyone via sharing their unique link, whether or not they have the Just Eat app, to improve accessibility.

## Save on delivery fees and reduce packaging
Making one big order - instead of separate ones as late arrivals trickle in - will save on delivery fees, transport emissions, and paclaging. We have kept our option to go cutlery-free, as well as offering alternative packaging and utensils where possible, such as bamboo and hemp.
